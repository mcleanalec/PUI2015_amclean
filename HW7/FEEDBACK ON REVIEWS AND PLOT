NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================


very small axis labels

background choice is distracting and reduces the visibility of the line, which however remains visible enough

it is an extremely simple plot, which however shows a very strong and interesging trend.

(what the graph shows is also very intriguing!)

(it was wrongly label HW7 - it is really important to be able to follow instructions.)

===========================================


mf3319
============
[!alt text](mf3358.png)

the station id is a categorical value, not a continuous one, so it should not be plotted as a position (and the idea of doing a regression on it is odd and really meaningless)

the regression lines are very thick, which does not add to readability. 

in blind siulations the colors become undistinguishable, particularly the green


lc3381

============

y axis extends above the data space

remove the empty space below 5 %

consider log space to cpmress the gaps and allow differences in the countries reporting small percentages to be seen

what is the legend on top? entirely not clear

labels for countries too small

top labels too small

============
good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)
