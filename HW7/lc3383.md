I like the graph a lot! The colors are engaging and it is very clear what is being conveyed. However, the little graph above the line graphs is a little confusing. I donâ€™t really understand what the numbers mean and it interferes with the rest of the graph. The tick lines are helpful to see how much is exactly spent on military and the labels for each continent also make the graph very clear. Overall a pretty cool graph!
