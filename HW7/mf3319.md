I like your graph a lot, but I think one of the only flaws is that it s not entirely clear what each layer is. One way to make the graph a little clearer would be to label the different layers and to label the y axis. The motivation and intent are interesting, the change in percentage throughout the years makes for a very interesting conversation.
