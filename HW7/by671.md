The graph is interesting and the colors are visually nice. I like the simplicity of the graph, however it is a little confusing. To me the graph is comparing average trip duration for subscribers versus customers, but I don’t understand what it was done in this way. I eventually understood the graph, but I think it could have been more effective as a bar graph. The plot describes the data, but it doesn’t really help the reader see the difference very clearly.
