In the beginning of the code I set a seed in order to make the results reproducible. The distributions first generated 100 randomly generated numbers between 10 and 2000 and then got the mean of those. Afterwards I plotted all of them, with the sample size on the x axis and sample mean on the y axis to illustrate the different distributions. I calculated the mean for each of them and stored them in a variable, for allmeans1 for the first distribution, allmeans2 for the second, and so on. Finally I made a new list that incorporates all of the means and with them I plotted a histogram.
